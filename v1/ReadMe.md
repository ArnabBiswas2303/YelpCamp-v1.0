# YelpCamp :tent:
This is a campground blogging/reviewing site. I made the front-end part using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript & JQuery and for the back-end I have used NodeJs, Express and MongoDB.<br>
[Note: For using this web app, you need to intall MongoDB on your computer and run mongod in the back ground. Also for using nodemailer, 
enter your email id where I have mentioned "YOUR EMAIL". For using Cloudinary, you need to get Cloudinary API key and make appropriate changes.]<br>
